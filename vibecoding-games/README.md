*   📄 **Having GLM Plan already?** [**GLM-4.6 Integration Guide (PDF)**](https://gitlab.com/ryzenadvanced/ultimate-custom-engineered-coding-agents-trae-ai-glm-4-6-vibe-coding-lab/-/blob/master/Adding_GLM_4.6_Model_to_TRAE__A_Visual_Guide__3_.pdf)

### 🚀 Why use SOLO with GLM 4.6?

*   **Save Your Fast Tokens:** Running the SOLO agent with the GLM 4.6 model **does not consume your TRAE paid fast tokens**.
*   **Cost-Effective Scaling:** Perform extensive, autonomous coding tasks without draining your premium credits.
*   **Optimized Workflow:** Reserve your TRAE fast tokens for urgent, high-priority interactive tasks while letting SOLO handle the heavy lifting in the background using GLM 4.6.
*   **Cost per action:** GLM 4.6 offers much lower cost, more affordable vibe coding experience compared to the other major models such as Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Opus 4.5/Sonnet 4.5.
